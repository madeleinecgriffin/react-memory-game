Welcome to the Marutaro Memory Game!

Maru is an Instragram famous shiba inu. In this game, you will try to click all of the pictures of him only once as they are reshuffled every time you click a picture. Can you focus enough to remember which ones you clicked while looking at that cute face? Find out now!

Your score will go up when you correctly click a picture you haven't clicked yet. If you click on a picture twice, your score will restart. Try to get all 12!
