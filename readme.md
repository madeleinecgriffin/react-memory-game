# React Memory Game with Marutaro

Welcome to the Marutaro memory game! This is a simple memory game built with React. There will be twelve pictures of Instragram-famous shiba inu Marutaro when you load the app. The object of the game is to click on each picture just once. The catch is, once you click a picture the order of the pictures displayed will be randomized, so you have to remember which is which.
